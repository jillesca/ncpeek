# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to `ncpeek`. We value your effort and contributions, but it's important to note upfront that `ncpeek` is a pet project primarily used for demos. While I welcome your contributions in the form of pull requests and bug reports, please understand that the support provided might be limited due to the nature of the project. If you have specific requirements or need extensive modifications, you might find it more efficient to fork the project.

## Pull Requests

Your pull requests are always appreciated. They could be corrections, bug fixes, or new featuresâ€”every contribution counts. Here's how you can submit a pull request:

- Fork the repository and create a new branch from master for your update.
- Implement the changes in your local branch.
- Push your local branch to your forked repository.
- Submit a pull request from your forked repository to our master branch.

## Bug Reports

If you spot a bug or an issue, I welcome your report. Please provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the problem, which will help to understand the issue better. However, remember that my capacity to address these issues might be constrained.

## Forking

Given the limited support for `ncpeek`, if you have extensive changes or specific requirements, I recommend forking the repository. This will allow you to freely explore and modify the project to better suit your needs. If you believe your modifications will benefit others, I warmly encourage you to create a pull request.

Thank you once again for your interest in `ncpeek`. Your understanding of the project's limitations is greatly appreciated.
